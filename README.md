# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis 
Module 7 Analysis

# Project Overview 
For this project, I am an HR Analyst at a large-enterprise corporation named Pewlett Hackard. I'm tasked with performing a large-scale employee retirement analysis to predict the number of upcoming retirements, who is eligible for retirement packages, and which roles will need to be refilled for future staffing purposes. 
who will be retiring in the next couple 



## Results
**Retiring Titles**

Out of the 300,000 employees at Pewlett Hackard, 90,398 (30.13%) are eligible for retirement packages which is roughly 1/3 of the total FTE. Within the 90,398 that are eligible for retirement packages, 29,415 (32.2%) are Senior Engineers and 28,254 (31.26%) are Senior Staffers. Below is a breakdown of the other retiring titles that I queried.

**Employees Eligible for Mentorship**
Looking at the workforce, only 1,940 employees qualify for mentorship oportunities. 


## **Summary:** 
Based on the findings of my analysis Pewlett Hackard is will experience over a 30% drop in the coming years due to employee retirement causing a large vacancy across multiple departments, in particular the engineering department. Taking into account the 1,940 employees who qualify for mentorship opportunities, Pewlett Hackard will still face a large deficit in their FTE count.
