# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis 
Module 7 Analysis

# Project Overview 
For this project, I am an HR Analyst at a large-enterprise corporation named Pewlett Hackard. I'm tasked with performing a large-scale employee retirement analysis to predict the number of upcoming retirements, who is eligible for retirement packages, and which roles will need to be refilled for future staffing purposes. 
who will be retiring in the next couple 



## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

Out of the 300,000 employees at Pewlett Hackard, 90,398 (30.13%) are eligible for retirement packages which is roughly 1/3 of the total FTE. 

Within the 90,398 that are eligible for retirement packages, 29,415 (32.2%) are Senior Engineers and 28,254 (31.26%) are Senior Staffers. Below is a breakdown of the other retiring titles that I queried. 



**How is the district summary affected?** 
The District data did not show any difference which proves consistency in the data. The Passing Math Score is relatively high at 75% as well as the Passing Reading scoresat 86%.

**How is the school summary affected?**
The overall School data showed little to no difference, similar to the District data.

## **Summary:** 
Upon removing the ninth grade data there showed to be little to no effect on the overall metrics. 

Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

*How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?*


*Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?*
